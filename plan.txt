Stories
  each users owns the database (can edit and delete the data)

  1) the first user catches a new tokimon to add to the empty database
      the user clicks the add button
      the add button sends the user to the addtokimon page
      the user enters the tokimons details into the proper text boxes
      the system error checks to make sure that the tokimon name doesn't match another
      the user clicks the submit button
      the data gets turned into an object
      the appropriate data gets entered into the database
      the user is redirected back to the home page (or the specific tokimon page)
  2) the user wants to edit the tokimon entered by another user
      the user clicks the edit button
      the user is taken to the newtokimon page with the current data set as default
      the user changes whatever text box is appropriate (except the name)
      the user clicks the submit button
      the data gets turned into an object
      the appropriate data gets entered into the database

  3) the user wants to delete a tokimon entered by another user
      the user clicks the delete button
      the tokimon is found in the database
      we delete the tokimon from the database
      we return the user to the home page
  4) the user wants to enter a tokimon into the database that already exists
      this should be handled in the newtokimon page

      the user enters the tokimons name into the search bar
      the user clicks the submit button
      we search the database for the tokimon
      if we dont find it we send back a notice
      if we do find it then we send the user to the tokimons page
